# Handle Multiple Promises with Promise.all()

There may be some instances where you want to handle multiple promises at the same time. For example, we may want to get data from multiple endpoints at the same time..



Instead of chaining multiple then methods, we can use Promise.all() to handle all of the promises at the same time. We will pass in an array of promises and then we can use the then method to
handle the response...


SEE the code .....
in which we fetch data from json files using promise.all()
